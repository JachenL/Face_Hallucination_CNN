# Face_Hallucination_CNN

## Introduction
This is a project that contains mainly three parts in three folders.
The hallucination and classfication is in Caffe and Python implementation is for VGGNet.
You can use face hallucination to hallucinate low-resolution input faces and the output HR faces can be used for recognition on VGGNet.
The Python implementation is expected to be portable to an Arm processor if the memory is large enough.
